I am in Odessa now.
I am living here for years and can't imagine living somewhere else. 
The city is a home to over a million people.
Odessa  is a city that has a seaport on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine.
I have visited a few countries and saw a lot of stunning views, but my heart leads me home - to Odessa.
